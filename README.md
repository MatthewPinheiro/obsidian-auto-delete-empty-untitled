# Auto-Delete Empty Untitled

Ever wish Obsidian would automatically get rid of those empty notes you created but didn't use? Here's a simple plugin for that.

## Features

If you close an empty note and its name is "Untitled" (or "Untitled 1", "Untitled 2", etc.), it automatically gets deleted. Useful for when you're quickly moving around and create a new note without adding any content.

Also respects your trash preference (system trash or Obsidian's `.trash` folder).
